## Description

This is a simple **Python number guessing game** where the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 10**, and the player has **3 valid attempts** to guess it correctly.

## How the Game Works

1. The computer randomly generates a number between **1 and 10**.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. The player has **3 valid guesses**:

   * Invalid inputs (non-integers or numbers outside the range) **do not count** as attempts.
4. If the player guesses correctly, the game ends with a success message.
5. If all attempts are used, the correct number is revealed.
6. The player is then asked whether they want to **play again**.
